= Introduction

The Couchbase Elasticsearch Connector replicates your documents from Couchbase Server to Elasticsearch in real time.
The connector service uses the high-performance Database Change Protocol (DCP) to receive notifications when documents change in Couchbase.
When a Couchbase change is saved to disk, the connector propagates the change to your Elasticsearch cluster.

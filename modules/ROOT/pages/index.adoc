Couchbase Server has built-in support for Full Text Search (FTS), but if Elasticsearch remains an important part of your system architecture, we've got you covered.

The Couchbase Elasticsearch Connector replicates your documents from Couchbase Server to Elasticsearch in real time.
The connector service uses the high-performance Database Change Protocol (DCP) to receive notifications when documents change in Couchbase.
When a Couchbase change is saved to disk, the connector propagates the change to your Elasticsearch cluster.

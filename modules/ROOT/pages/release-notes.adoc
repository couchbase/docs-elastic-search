:description: Elasticsearch Connector release notes

== Standalone Connector vs. Plug-in

Starting with version 4.0 the connector is now a standalone process.
The standalone distribution archives are named `couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-`, and download links are provided on this page.

Prior to version 4.0 the connector was implemented as an Elasticsearch plug-in.
The plug-in distributions have archive names starting with `elasticsearch-transport-couchbase-`.

TIP: If you want to use the old plug-in, distributions may be https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/releases[downloaded from GitHub].
Make sure to pick the archive whose `es` version component _exactly_ matches your Elasticsearch version.
For example, to use the 3.0.0 version of the plug-in with Elasticsearch 5.6.4, you would select `elasticsearch-transport-couchbase-3.0.0-cypress-es5.6.4.zip`.

== Elasticsearch Connector 4.2.0 (2019-10-15)

https://packages.couchbase.com/clients/connectors/elasticsearch/4.2.0/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.2.0.zip[couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.2.0.zip]

Hot on the heels of 4.1, we're releasing 4.2 with support for connecting directly to an Amazon Elasticsearch Service instance.
There's a new `[elasticsearch.aws]` config section for specifying the AWS region of the service.
Amazon credentials are obtained from the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html[Default Credential Provider Chain].

Also new in 4.2, the `cbes-consul` command now takes an optional `--consul-config` argument which points to a separate config file where you can specify a Consul ACL token.

On the version compatibility front, we've added support for Elasticsearch 7.4 and removed support for Elasticsearch 5.4 (which reached EOL on 2018-11-04).

=== Enhancements

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-129[CBES-129] Support direct connections to Amazon Elasticsearch Service
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-140[CBES-140] Support ACL Token Authentication when communicating with Consul
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-141[CBES-141] Extend support coverage to Elasticsearch 7.4

== Elasticsearch Connector 4.1.0 (2019-09-05)

https://packages.couchbase.com/clients/connectors/elasticsearch/4.1.0/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.1.0.zip[couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.1.0.zip]

We are excited to unveil the new Autonomous Operations (AO) mode with major improvements to the availability and manageability of the connector.
When the connector is deployed in AO mode, worker processes use your HashiCorp Consul cluster to communicate with each other and automatically distribute the replication workload.
You can add or remove worker processes at any time without having to manually stop and reconfigure all of the workers.
Any worker that fails a health check is automatically removed, and its workload is redistributed among remaining workers.

The new `cbes-consul` command line tool is used to start a worker in AO mode.
It also provides streamlined checkpoint management and the ability to reconfigure or pause/resume all of the workers in an AO group at once.

Also new in this release is support for multi-network configuration.
This feature allows the connector to talk to Couchbase Server nodes that have been configured to advertise alternate network addresses for connecting to the node from outside a container/cloud networking environment.
The new `network` property in the `[couchbase]` section of the configuration gives you control over network selection (although the default value of `auto` is appropriate for most cases).

Finally, the range of supported Elasticsearch versions is extended to include 7.1, 7.2. and 7.3.

=== Enhancements

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-65[CBES-65] Autonomous Operations Mode with Consul
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-135[CBES-135] Expose multi-network config options
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-138[CBES-138] Upgrade to Couchbase client 2.7.9 and DCP client 0.24.0

== Elasticsearch Connector 4.0.2 (2019-05-21)

https://packages.couchbase.com/clients/connectors/elasticsearch/4.0.2/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.0.2.zip[couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.0.2.zip]

This maintenance release fixes a bug that prevented some versions of Couchbase Server from rebalancing when the connector is running.

It also adds compatibility with the official Docker images for Elasticsearch 6.7.x and 7.0.x, and is the first version tested against OpenJDK 8 and OpenJDK 11.

=== Enhancements

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-122[CBES-122] Add support for OpenJDK
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-123[CBES-123] Support Elasticsearch 6.7 & 7.0 docker images
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-125[CBES-125] Suppress "types removal" warnings from Elasticsearch 7.0

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-128[CBES-128] Couchbase Server fails to rebalance if Elasticsearch connector is running


== Elasticsearch Connector 4.0.1 (2019-04-15)

https://packages.couchbase.com/clients/connectors/elasticsearch/4.0.1/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.0.1.zip[couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.0.1.zip]

This maintenance release improves the stability of the connector and adds new configuration options.

=== Enhancements

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-90[CBES-90] Ability to use environment variables inside config
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-107[CBES-107] Misleading error message when can't connect to Elasticsearch
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-110[CBES-110] Need document routing to support join
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-114[CBES-114] Allow saving checkpoints in a different bucket

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-117[CBES-117] Connector exits on values that fail to parse

== Elasticsearch Connector 4.0.0 (2018-10-12)

https://packages.couchbase.com/clients/connectors/elasticsearch/4.0.0/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.0.0.zip[couchbase-elasticsearch-connector-4.0.0.zip]

=== New in this version

* The connector is now a standalone process instead of an Elasticsearch plug-in.

* Compatible with Elasticsearch versions 5 and 6.

* Support for secure connections to Couchbase and Elasticsearch.

* Tools for managing replication checkpoints.

* A "rejection log" for documents Elasticsearch permanently refuses to index.

* Configurable document structure (omit metadata if you don't need it).

* The connector now listens for document changes using the high performance Couchbase Database Change Protocol (DCP).

==== Things to be aware of

CAUTION: This is a major version upgrade.
Because the plug-in and the standalone connector are so different, there is no online upgrade process.
See the xref:migration.adoc[Migration] documentation for details.

* Parent-child relationships are no longer supported, as this feature
was removed in ES 6.

* Routing documents to specific Elasticsearch shards is not implemented.
Please let us know if this feature is still relevant for your deployment.

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 3.0.2 (2018-09-18)

Maintenance release for improved compatibility and stability.

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-82[CBES-82]: NoClassDefFoundError under Java 9.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-83[CBES-83]: VersionConflictEngineException in storeUUID if document already exists.
(Causes XDCR replication to be removed.)

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 3.0.1 (2018-02-18)

The `birch` development line has been retired.
The `cypress` line now supports all 5.x versions of Elasticsearch.

`RegexParentSelector` now reads the parent ID format from the correct config property (`couchbase.parentSelector.documentTypesParentFormat.<type>`).
If you previously put the parent ID format in the `documentTypeParentFields` property as a workaround, please update your configuration.

The connector can now delete child documents and other documents that have custom routing.
If you're using `RegexParentSelector` then this feature has no additional overhead.
Otherwise, for each document whose routing cannot be derived from the document ID, the connector creates a separate signpost document to record the routing.
Be aware that child documents created by previous versions of the connector are not eligible for deletion, since they don't have signposts (you'll see "missing signpost" warnings in the log when the connector tries to delete those documents).

The signposts have a document type of `couchbaseSignpost`.
The mapping for this type must store the contents of the `meta` field.
This is already the case if you're using the default mapping template included in the plug-in distribution.

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-49[CBES-49]: RegexParentSelector reads parent ID format from wrong config property.
* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-50[CBES-50]: RoutingMissingException when deleting child documents.

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 3.0.0 (2017-11-22)

With https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/releases/tag/3.0.0-cypress[this release], the Couchbase plug-in for Elasticsearch moves to a new versioning and branch management strategy that allows for simultaneous releases across ES versions (see <<Version Compatibility>>).
All the versions are expected to work and are supported.
However, versions which have received more testing and are *officially* supported are:

* 3.0.0-cypress-es5.6.4
* 3.0.0-birch-es5.2.2
* 3.0.0-alder-es2.4.0

Don't be alarmed by the major version bump; upgrading from version 2.x of the plug-in should be seamless, and is recommended for all users.
The code has just been relabeled for easier maintenance.

=== New Feature

* Adds the `couchbase.pipeline` config for specifying the ingestion pipeline.

=== Enhancements

* Improves logging for indexing errors.
* Uses Dropwizard Metrics to collect and log richer stats.

=== Bug Fixes

* https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/CBES-48[CBES-48]: Connection counter leak could cause spurious `TooManyConcurrentConnections` errors.
* https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-elasticsearch-connector/issues/153[#153]: ClassCastException error when the TTL is of type `Long` instead of `Integer`.

=== Known issues

The Elasticsearch Plug-in does not support IPv6.
So to use the plug-in, the Couchbase Server and Elasticsearch clusters will need to run on instances which are addressable with IPv4.

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 2.2 (2017-02)

This release note applies to the 2.2 version of the Elasticsearch Transport Plug-in (February 2017).
It adds a number of bug fixes.
See xref:getting-started.adoc[Installation and Configuration] for versioning and compatibility information.

== Elasticsearch Plug-in 2.1.1 (2015-09)

This release note applies to the 2.1.1 version of the Elasticsearch Transport Plug-in (September 2015).
It adds compatibility with newer Elasticsearch versions up to 1.7.x, multiple new features, and quite a few bug fixes, including several that solve issues found in 2.1.0.
In particular, this release fixes a long-standing bug with an incorrect concurrent bulk request counter, which could eventually cause the plug-in to stop accepting requests from Couchbase Server altogether.

Some configuration option-names changed.
